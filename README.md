The quality of a wine is important for the consumers as well as the wine industry. The traditional (expert) way of measuring wine quality
is time-consuming. Nowadays, machine learning models are
important tools to replace human tasks. In this case, there are several
features to predict the wine quality but the entire features will not be
relevant for better prediction. So, our thesis work is focusing on what
wine features are important to get the promising result. For the purpose
of classification model and evaluation of the relevant features, we used
three algorithms namely support vector machine (SVM), naïve Bayes
(NB), and artificial neural network (ANN). In this study, we used two
wine quality datasets red wine and white wine. To evaluate the feature
importance we used the Pearson coefficient correlation and
performance measurement matrices such as accuracy, recall,
precision, and f1 score for comparison of the machine learning
algorithm. A grid search algorithm was applied to improve the model
accuracy. Finally, we achieved the artificial neural network (ANN)
algorithm has better prediction results than the Support Vector
Machine (SVM) algorithm and the Naïve Bayes (NB) algorithm for
both red wine and white wine dataset
